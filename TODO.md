# Todo List
- Redo the entire download process. Currently it is very very clunky, and the implementation is terrible. It essentially acts as a second client and it would be much better if this was either implemented as part of the original client (server-sided client), or if the entire download flow was redone both client and server side.
- Implement the Lua API (and discuss wanted changes).
- Implement the auth-key stuff to have public servers be possible.
